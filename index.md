  Hi There! My name is Sameer 'Sammy' Mehra, and I am a senior at Harvard University,
  where I study Computer Science.

  In my free time I like to build silly computer programs and listen to Jazz. I am 
  hoping to work in Software Engineering when I graduate because I love to create useful
  products and make the world more user-friendly. 

  Thanks for stopping by!
