<p>
  Hello! I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a rich 6-year tenure at LinkedIn, marked by groundbreaking projects and
  relentless pursuit of knowledge. Ask me about Content Management Systems, Ads Rendering, and Accessibility. I have
  academic experience in Machine Learning, and I'm currently exploring the exciting world of AutoML.
</p>
<h2>Professional Journey</h2>
<p>Since graduating from Harvard College in 2017, I have been deeply immersed in two pivotal roles at LinkedIn:</p>
<p>
  Innovator in the Marketing Team: My journey began with the creation of a Content Management System from scratch. This
  system, built with Java in the Play framework, empowered non-technical marketing professionals to craft landing pages
  effortlessly. The choice of Apache Jackrabbit Oak on MySQL mirrors the hierarchical nature of DOM information. It's
  the same db paradigm that underlies Adobe's 'Experience Manager' product (AEM).
</p>
<p>
  Pioneer in the Ads Rendering Team: Transitioning to the ads rendering team, I took charge of refining the data flow,
  from database management to auction, and eventually to the user interface, built in Ember. My role was instrumental in
  streamlining processes and enhancing user experience on the platform.
</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  My academic experience at Harvard laid a strong foundation in software engineering, instilling in me a lifelong love
  for learning and technological innovation.
</p>
<h2>Passion Beyond Work</h2>
<p>
  My enthusiasm extends into the realm of AutoML, an exciting and evolving area within Machine Learning. AutoML aims to
  automate the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It simplifies the complex process of model
  selection, pre-processing, parameter tuning, and more, making ML more accessible and efficient. This field resonates
  with my love for solving complex problems and my belief in democratizing technology.
</p>
<h2>My Ethos</h2>
<p>
  At the core of my professional philosophy is a commitment to using technology to demystify complexities and enhance
  user experience. This includes a strong focus on web accessibility, ensuring that digital platforms are inclusive and
  accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities. I am dedicated to creating solutions that are not only
  efficient and user-centric but also universally accessible, reflecting my belief in the power of technology to create
  an inclusive world.
</p>
<p>
  As I continue on my professional path, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead, especially in
  areas where technology intersects with real-world challenges.
