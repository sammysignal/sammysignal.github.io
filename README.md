# sammysignal.github.io
This is the code for my personal website, which can be viewed at [sameermehra.com](https://sameermehra.com/)

It is generated using the following technologies:

 - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
 - [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - which is built right into github pages. It uses the [jackal](https://github.com/clenemt/jackal) theme.

Run locally with:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

...as well as some personal tweaking. Thanks for checking it out! I suppose if you wanted to run this site locally you could do something like [this](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
